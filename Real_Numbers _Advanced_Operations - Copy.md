# üî¢ Real Numbers Advanced Operations

Real numbers constitute a fundamental set in mathematics, encompassing both rational and irrational numbers. Advanced operations on real numbers, such as exponentiation, are essential in various mathematical disciplines, including algebra, calculus, and number theory. A rigorous understanding of these operations is crucial for solving complex problems across scientific, engineering, and computational domains.

This section provides a formal exploration of exponents and their significance in real number operations.

## Exponentiation
For every real number $a$ and a positive integer $n$, the exponentiation $a^n$ represents the product of $a$ multiplied by itself $n$ times:

$$a^n = \underbrace{a \times a \times a \times \dots \times a}_{n\text{ factors}}$$

For cases where $n$ is not a positive integer, exponentiation is defined through its algebraic properties and extensions.

### Fundamental Exponentiation Rules
For any real number $a \neq 0$ and real numbers $m, n$:

1. **Multiplication Rule:**
   $$a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$$

2. **Division Rule:**
   $$\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}, \quad a \neq 0$$

3. **Power of a Power Rule:**
   $$(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}$$

4. **Power of a Product Rule:**
   $$(a \cdot b)^n = a^n \cdot b^n$$

5. **Power of a Quotient Rule:**
   $$\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}, \quad b \neq 0$$

6. **Fractional Exponents:**
   $$a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m$$

### Special Cases
1. **Zero Exponent:**
   $$a^0 = 1, \quad a \neq 0$$

2. **Negative Exponent:**
   $$a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}, \quad a \neq 0$$

3. **Radical Representation:**
   $$a^{\frac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a}$$

### Justification of Exponentiation Properties
Exponentiation is defined in such a way that it maintains consistency with the fundamental exponent rules. For instance, the rule $a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m}$ follows from:

$$a^m \times a^{-m} = a^{m-m} = a^0 = \frac{a^m}{a^m} = 1$$

## üìè Absolute Value

The absolute value of a real number represents its distance from zero on the number line, disregarding direction. It is a fundamental concept in mathematics with applications in algebra, calculus, and real analysis.

### Definition
For any real number $x$, the absolute value of $x$, denoted $|x|$, is defined as:

\[
|x| = \begin{cases} 
 x, & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
 -x, & \text{if } x < 0 
\end{cases}
\]

#### Example Calculations
- $|5| = 5$
- $|-3| = 3$
- $|0| = 0$

### Properties of Absolute Value
For all real numbers $a$ and $b$:

1. **Non-negativity:**
   \[
   |a| \geq 0
   \]
   The absolute value is always non-negative.

2. **Identity Property:**
   \[
   |a| = 0 \iff a = 0
   \]
   The only number with an absolute value of zero is zero itself.

3. **Multiplicative Property:**
   \[
   |a \cdot b| = |a| \cdot |b|
   \]

4. **Triangle Inequality:**
   \[
   |a + b| \leq |a| + |b|
   \]
   The absolute value of a sum is at most the sum of the absolute values.

5. **Subtractive Inequality:**
   \[
   |a - b| \geq ||a| - |b||
   \]

### Geometric Interpretation
The absolute value of a number represents its distance from zero on the number line. For example:

- $|3|$ and $|-3|$ both equal 3, meaning both numbers are three units away from zero.
- The expression $|x - 5|$ represents the distance between $x$ and 5 on the number line.

### Applications of Absolute Value
1. **Solving Equations and Inequalities:**
   - Example: Solve $|x - 2| = 5$
     \[
     x - 2 = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -5
     \]
     \[
     x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -3
     \]

2. **Distance and Measurement:**
   - Absolute value is used to define distance in both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional spaces.

3. **Error Analysis:**
   - Absolute values are used in error estimation and approximations.
