# ðŸ”¢ Real Numbers
Consider all numbers (rational and irrational) that can measure lengths, together with their negatives and zero. 
We call these numbers the **real numbers**.

## Real Numbers Operations
Set of real numbers with operation whether it's addition, multiplication, substraction or division create a system called **Real Numbers Operations**.

### Basic Arithmetic Operations

- **Addition:** Combines two or more numbers to find their sum. 
- **Subtraction:** Finds the difference between two numbers. 
- **Multiplication:** Combines two or more numbers to find their product.
- **Division:** Finds the quotient when one number is divided by another (excluding division by zero). 

### Advanced Operations

- **Exponentiation:** Raises a number (base) to a certain power (exponent). It is used to express repeated multiplication (e.g., $2^3 = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2 = 8$).
- **Root Extraction:** Finds the root of a number, which is the inverse operation of exponentiation. For example, the square root of $9$ is $3$ because $3^2 = 9$.

## Properties of Real Number Operations

Real number operations satisfy several important properties, including:

- **Closure:** The result of an operation on real numbers is always a real number (e.g., the sum of two real numbers is a real number).
- **Identity:** There exists a unique identity element for each operation (e.g., 0 for addition, 1 for multiplication).
- **Comutative:** $$x+y=y+x$$ $$xy=yx$$
- **Associative:** $$x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z$$ $$x(yz)=(xy)z$$
- **Distributivity:** $$(a Ã— (b + c) = a Ã— b + a Ã— c)$$.
- **Inverse:** For every real number, there exists an inverse element (e.g., -a for addition, 1/a for multiplication, except for 0).

> **Division are define by :**

> $$\frac{x}{y}=x(\frac{1}{y})$$


### Order of Operations

When evaluating expressions involving multiple operations, the order of operations is crucial. A common mnemonic is PEMDAS or BODMAS:

1.  **P**arentheses (or **B**rackets)
2.  **E**xponents (or **O**rders)
3.  **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (from left to right)
4.  **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)

## Real Numbers Line

The real number line is a visual representation of all real numbers. 
It's a horizontal line where each point corresponds to exactly one real number, and every real number corresponds to exactly one point on the line. 
It's a fundamental tool for understanding and visualizing the properties of real numbers.

### Key Features

- **Horizontal Line:** The real number line is typically drawn as a horizontal line extending infinitely in both directions.

- **Origin:** A point on the line is chosen as the origin, representing the number zero.

- **Positive Numbers:** Numbers greater than zero (positive numbers) are located to the right of the origin. The further a point is to the right, the larger the number it represents.

- **Negative Numbers:** Numbers less than zero (negative numbers) are located to the left of the origin. The further a point is to the left, the smaller (more negative) the number it represents.

- **Ordering:** The real number line visually represents the order of real numbers. It will be explained more thorough in the next section.

- **Density:** Between any two real numbers, no matter how close they are, there are infinitely many other real numbers. This is called the density property. You can always find another number between any two given numbers.

- **Completeness:** The real number line is "complete" in the sense that it contains all real numbers. There are no "gaps" in the line. Every point corresponds to a real number, and every real number has a corresponding point. (This is a more subtle and advanced concept that distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers, for example.)

- **Representation of Different Number Types:** The real number line includes:
    - **Integers:** Whole numbers (positive, negative, and zero) are marked at equal intervals along the line.
    - **Rational Numbers:** Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction p/q, where p and q are integers and q is not zero, are also located on the line. These include terminating and repeating decimals.
    - **Irrational Numbers:** Numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction (e.g., âˆš2, Ï€) are also on the line. Their decimal representations are non-repeating and non-terminating.

### How it's Used

- **Visualizing Numbers:** The real number line provides a visual representation of numbers, making it easier to understand their relationships and order.
- **Comparing Numbers:** It helps in comparing numbers and determining which one is greater or smaller.
- **Understanding Operations:** It can be used to illustrate arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. For example, adding a positive number can be visualized as moving to the right on the number line.
- **Graphing:** It's the basis for the Cartesian coordinate system (x-y plane), where two real number lines are used to plot points.

### Ordering
The real number line visually represents the order of real numbers. 
Numbers to the left are always smaller than numbers to the right. 
This makes it easy to compare numbers.

**Symbols :**

$$<,>,\geq,\leq$$

#### Properties of Ordering
If $x,y,z$ is a real numbers. It  applies properties called, 

1. **Tricotomy:** for every $x$ and $y$, it applies $x<y$ or $x>y$ or $x=y$
 
2. **Transitive:** if $x<y$ and $y<z$ then $x<z$

3. **Addition:** if $x<y$ then $x+z<y+z$

4. **Multiplication:** 
   1. If $z$ is positive and $x<y$ then $xz<yz$
   2. If $z$ is negative and $x<y$ then $xz>yz$

> Properties 2,3,4 also applies to $\geq,\leq$
