# 🔢 Classification of Numbers (Number Systems)

## 🌟 Introduction
Numbers are everywhere! Whether you're counting steps, checking the time, calculating expenses, or measuring ingredients for your favorite meal, numbers play a crucial role in daily life. But have you ever wondered why some numbers are whole while others include decimals? Or why symbols like \( \pi \) and \( \sqrt{2} \) exist? 🤔

Understanding how numbers are classified helps us unlock the hidden structure behind mathematics, from simple tasks to advanced calculus (*cough* foreshadowing *cough* 😏).

Number classification is the foundation of all mathematical concepts, allowing us to:

✅ Organize and understand different numerical systems.
✅ Identify patterns and relationships between numbers.
✅ Build a strong foundation for solving equations, analyzing data, and programming algorithms.

Let's dive into the fascinating **hierarchy of numbers** and explore their unique properties! 🚀

## 📊 Types of Numbers

### Complex 
All numbers which can be expressed in the form $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numnbers and $i=\sqrt{-1}$.
Each complex number is a combination of a real number ($\Re$ or $\mathbb{R}$) and an imaginary number $\Im$.

Symbols :
$$\mathbb{C}$$

Set Examples :

$$1+2i,1,i,-3i,0,-5+i$$

### Imaginary 
Numbers which are the product of a real number and the imaginary unit $i$ where $i=\sqrt{-1}$.

Symbols :
$$\Im$$ or {Im}

Set Examples :

$$2i=\sqrt{-4},-5i=-\sqrt{-25}$$

### Real 
Numbers that correspond to points along a line. They can be positive, negative, or zero.

Symbols :
$$\mathbb{R}$$ or {Re}

Set Examples :

$$\frac{1}{5},1,0,-3,\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$$

### Irrational 
All real numbers which can't be expressed as a fraction $\frac{n}{p}$ whose numerator and denominator are integers.
(i.e. all real numbers which aren't rational).

Symbols :
$$\mathbb{I}$$

Set Examples :

$$\pi,\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}$$

### Rational

All real numbers which can be expressed as a fraction, $\frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$. 
All integers are rational numbers as 1 is a non-zero integer.

Symbols :
$$\mathbb{Q}$$

Set Examples : 
$$\frac{1}{5},\frac{5}{1}$$


### Integers 
All positive and negative whole numbers.

Symbols :
$$\mathbb{Z}$$

Set Examples :
$$...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...$$

### Whole 
All positive whole numbers and zero.

Symbols :
$$\mathbb{W}$$

Set Examples :
$$0,1,2,...$$

### Natural
Numbers used for counting (all positive integers).


Symbols :
$$\mathbb{N}$$

Set Examples :
$$1,2,...$$
